## Introduction
Implemented basic machine learning algorithms in Python using famous package [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

### Problem 1: Perceptron Learning for the Iris Dataset
- Load iris dataset in sklearn.
- Merge virginica and versicolor classes. You can show number of data points and categories (using `np.unique`) before and after merge.
- Segment data into training set and test set.
- Train a Perceptron on training data.
- Test on test data.
- Report training and test error.

### Problem 2: Decision Trees as Interpretable Models
- Reuse loaded dataset from Problem 1.
- Build a decision tree on the training set.
- Plot the decision tree.
- Convert the decision rules into a set of IF-THEN rules.
- Test the decision tree on test set and report the test error.
